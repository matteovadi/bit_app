Web-based App with R - Shiny for the scheduling operations within a printing company

I apologize for the italian terms but the code is also designed to be easily understandable by the final user who is not skilled about programming with R and with the English language.
The App is used for scheduling a new book order in the correct machines inside the company, in order to optimize the production, according to specific thresholds accurately estimated.
In the original version, there are 8 R scripts. The first thing to do is to run "start_bn.R" in R-Studio with the specific inputs for the very first book order (i.e. all the book input and the starting date). Then is possible to run locally the main script which is "app.R" and updates the order calendar with all the new features.
